Creating basic classes
-----------------------
Generate the basic classes i.e Object, Int, Bool, String, IO.
Build the classes with appropriate methods and attributes for 
further use.

Basic IR code 
-------------
Hardcode the data-layout and target.
Hardcode the LLVM IR for methods of the Basic Classes.
This is maintained in the BoilerPlate class.

Process Classes
---------------
Process every class and emit the class declaration for each of them.
Emit the IR for Virtual Table for functions. 
Currently the module supports function code generation for basic classes only.
